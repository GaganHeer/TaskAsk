### Installation and Operation

We recommend running Node 8.9.0 or higher.  Run `npm install` to install all relevant node modules.

Also before running you must setup your App in the Slack API and create a PostgreSQL database.  Once these are ready you will have to provide the relevant variables through either your server Environment Variables or by hardcoding them into `./src/config.js`.  If you do decide to hardcode your variables you should add `./src/config.js` to the `.gitignore` file.  This will prevent your sensitive credentials from being exposed to the public on your Git Repository.

Once all of this is complete you can run the app through `node ./src/index.js`.
